To get started with the project files, you'll need to:
1. Install Python on [Windows/Mac/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)
2. Install pip on [Windows/Mac/Linux](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## About The Machine Learning Workshop
You already know you want to learn machine learning, and a smarter way to understanding machine learning is to learn by doing. The Machine Learning Workshop focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can develop applications for predicting future outcomes, or even apply an unsupervised algorithm to a real-life dataset using machine learning fundamentals. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results. 

## What you will learn
* Distinguish between supervised and unsupervised ML models
* Learn popular algorithms, such as K-means, Mean-Shift, and DBSCAN 
* Discover ways to approach machine learning classification problems 
* Develop neural network structures using the scikit-learn package 
* Use the NN algorithm to create models for predicting future outcomes 
* Perform error analysis to improve the performance of your models ,
